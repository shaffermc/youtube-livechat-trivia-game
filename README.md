Commands:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
!Trivia - start the game

!highscores - List top scores  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Customize the Configuration File:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Open YoutubeTriviaBot.exe.config   
Edit the following values. Use double backslashes for directory names. Also might want to use a directory with a short simple path  
with no spaces or special characters, etc.   
  
Add questions and answers to the questions.txt and answers.txt.  
The question and answer should be on the same line in each file.  
Don't put question mark at the end of the questions. The bot adds the question mark.   
The cursor should be on the next line at the end of the document. There shouldn't be any extra lines.  
Using NotePad++ seems to show more if there are hidden lines or text that could interfere with reading   
the file.   

questionsLocation - location to the questions.txt  
answersLocation - location to the answers.txt  
scoresLocation - location to the scores.txt  
clientSecretsLocation - location to the client_secrets.json  
getMsgDelay - how often in seconds that the bot retrieves chat messages from youtube  
questionDelay - time period to answer question  
advertiseDelay - how long in seconds between advertising the trivia bot's commands in the chat  
livechatid - the unique id of the chat found in step 2  
botName - set this to match the name of the bot's user name, for example Trivia Bot. This is so the bot ignores messages from itself in the chat.  
restrictedAdd - set to "yes" and only the name in the questionAuthor field will be able to add questions. Set to "no" and anyone can use the add question command  
questionAuthor - the bot will only add questions from this user name if restrictedAdd is set to "yes"  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Run the Program:  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Double click the YoutubeTriviaBot.exe to run the program  
After about 10 seconds it will finish startup  
If you have the correct LiveChatID you should see messages in the console window  
when someone types something in the chat  
There aren't any commands that can be entered in the console, everything is done  
in the chat.
